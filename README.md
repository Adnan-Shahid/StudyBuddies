Study buddy is an online collaborative notebook that allows students to upload both typed and handwritten notes that will convert them into text stored with various tags using image recognition/natural language processing. This lets students search through their notes with ease instead of flipping through several pages in a binder. Students will be able to share their uploaded files with others to use in their own notebooks if they desire. They will also be able to scrape web pages to summarize information and place it in their notebook.

## Key Features for Beta Version:
- Local search engine for the websiteâ€™s repo
- Handwritten text and typed text image recognition with automatically applied tags
- Uploading/Removing images of notes/option to take picture
- Sharing notes with other users
- Basic users, permission setups and authentication
- Notebook organization (i.e. tabs, subjects)

## Additional Features for Final Version:
- Collaborative 'whiteboard' that you can save and apply image recognition (to transcribe)
- Collaborative notebooks
- Web crawler to upload lecture notes into the notebook
- Point system for users that upload notes

## Description of Technology We Will Use:
- Google Cloud Vision API or Google OCR for image recognition
- Keyword recognition API
- Paragraph Summarization API
- Websockets to implement collaboration
- React.js for front end
- MongoDB for back end
- Web scraper to crawl sites
- Drawing tool for whiteboards

## Top 5 Technical Challenges:
- Learning to use React.js to create a dynamic frontend experience
- Implementing and using image recognition API to convert handwritten text to typed
- Implementing websockets to allow for collaborative work
- Learning how to utilize a web scraper and conventions for archiving/gathering web data
- Using multiple APIs in conjunction with one another to develop a unified product
